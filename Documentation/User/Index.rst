Insert Plugin on Page
---------------------

..  rst-class:: bignums

    Switch to page module, choose your newly created page in pagetree. Click the "+ content" button to start
    the Content Element Wizard. Switch to tab `Plugin` and click on panel with name `Forum` to add the plugin
    to the page.

    If you want you can give that content element a name and configure another detail view on tab "Plugin".

    Don't forget to save your record.

Create Forum Records
--------------------

It's your job to create some forum records where users can create topics and posts for. A forum record is
meant to be a category or discussion topic like "Let's talk about cars", "Sell and buy" or just simple
"Windows 11".

..  rst-class:: bignums

1.  Create storage

    Create a new page of type "Storage Folder" in pagetree.

2.  Create Forum record

    Switch to list module and chose your just created storage folder from pagetree. On the right frame click
    the `+` Button at the upper left. Search section `Forum` and click `Forum` from the list below to create a new
    forum record.

    Fill in values for title (required) and teaser. Do not add any teaser records. That's a job for your
    users in frontend.
