TypoScript
==========

`iframecache` needs some basic TypoScript configuration. To do so you have to add an +ext template to either the root
page of your website or to a specific page which contains the `iframecache` plugin.

..  rst-class:: bignums

1.  Locate page

    You have to decide where you want to insert the TypoScript template. Eithe root page or page with `iframecache` plugin
    is OK.

2.  Create TypoScript template

    Switch to template module and choose the specific page from above in the pagetree. Choose
    `Click here to create an extension template` from the right frame. In the TYPO3 community it is also known as
    "+ext template".

3.  Add static template

    Choose `Info/Modify` from the upper selectbox and then click on `Edit the whole template record` button below
    the little table. On tab `Includes` locate the section `Include static (from extension)`. Use the search below
    `Available items` to search for `iframecache`. Hopefully just one record is visible below. Choose it, to move that
    record to the left.

4.  Save

    If you want you can give that template a name on tab "General", save and close it.

5.  Constants Editor

    Choose `Constant Editor` from the upper selectbox.

6.  `iframecache` constants

    Choose `PLUGIN.TX_IFRAMECACHE` from the category selectbox to show just `iframecache` related constants

7.  Configure constants

    Adapt the constants to your needs.

8.  Configure TypoScript

    As constants will only allow modifiying a fixed selection of TypoScript you also switch to `Info/Modify` again
    and click on `Setup`. Here you have the possibility to configure all `iframecache` related configuration.

View
====

view.templateRootPaths

Persistence
===========

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.storagePid = 21,45,3234`


Settings
========

settings.auth
-------------

Default: 1 (no authentication)

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.auth = 2`

Define, if creation of new topics and posts needs an authenticated frontend user or not.

*   Value: `1`: No authentication. Everyone can create topics and posts. We prefer using it in intranet environments.
*   Value: `2`: An authenticated frontend user is needed to create topics and posts.

..  note::

    If you choose `1` with each created topic and/or post a new iframecache own user record will be created.

settings.emailIsMandatory
-------------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.emailIsMandatory = 1`

If activated a further input field will be displayed where the user has to insert a valid email address.
Useful in case of `auth = 1`. The email address will be added to iframecache own user record.

settings.usernameIsMandatory
----------------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.usernameIsMandatory = 1`

If activated a further input field will be displayed where the user has to insert a username.
Useful in case of `auth = 1`. The username will be added to iframecache own user record.

settings.useImages
------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.useImages = 1`

If activated two additional upload fields will be added to the form of new topics and posts.

settings.uidOfAdminGroup
------------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.uidOfAdminGroup = 14`

With this setting you can define a frontend usergroup which should act as an administrator to edit
and delete records in frontend view.

settings.uidOfUserGroup
-----------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.uidOfUserGroup = 26`

If authentication is required `auth = 2` you have to define a frontend usergroup which is allowed to create
new topics and posts.

settings.pidOfDetailPage
------------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.pidOfDetailPage = 26`

By default all detail view are displayed on the same page of the forum record list. For design reasons
it may make sense to define a special detail view page.

settings.topic.hideAtCreation
-----------------------------

Default: 0

By default every new topic created over frontend is directly visible. If you want to prevent

settings.topic.activateByAdmin
------------------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.topic.activateByAdmin = 1`

By default hidden records can only be activated by a backend editor. If you want your frontend
administrator to enable hidden topics you should activate this option here.

settings.post.hideAtCreation
----------------------------

Default: 0

Example: `plugin.tx_iframecache.settings.post.hideAtCreation = 1`

By default every new post created over frontend is directly visible. If you want to prevent

Only valid, if you have activated `useImages`. Define the default storage location
for uploaded images in frontend context.

settings.image.*
----------------

Default:

..  code-block:: typoscript

    settings.image {
      width = 120c
      height = 90c
      minWidth = 120
      maxWidth = 120
      minHeight = 90
      maxHeight = 90
    }

With these values you can manipulate the topic and post image size.

settings.pageBrowser.itemsPerPage
---------------------------------

Default: 15
